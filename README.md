# ðŸ“‚ Java Project â€” Parallel File Processing

This project demonstrates a multithreaded system in Java, where:
- A **Master** thread coordinates the work.
- **Worker** threads perform file-related tasks.
- The system reads data from files using a `Read_File` class.

## 
- `Master.java`: Initializes and manages worker threads.
- `Worker.java`: Each thread that performs file processing tasks.
- `Read_File.java`: Handles reading data from text files.

##  Concepts Demonstrated

- Java Threads and concurrency
- File I/O using BufferedReader
- Task coordination between threads
- Object-Oriented Design
